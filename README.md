**Data Pipeline Implementation Using Azure Services**

**About This Project**

This project showcases the design and implementation of a comprehensive data pipeline that processes raw data from Kaggle through an end-to-end solution built on Azure cloud services. The goal was to create a robust, scalable pipeline that automates data ingestion, transformation, storage, and analysis, ultimately enabling data-driven decision-making.
The pipeline begins with Azure Data Factory, which orchestrates the extraction of raw data from Kaggle. Once ingested, the data is stored in Azure Data Lake Storage. Azure Databricks is then employed to develop and execute Spark-based transformations, refining the raw data into a more usable form. The transformed data is then stored back into Azure Data Lake Storage for further processing. Finally, Azure Synapse Analytics is used to run SQL queries on the transformed data, uncovering insights and creating visualizations that drive informed decisions.
This project not only demonstrates the integration of multiple Azure services but also highlights the efficiency and scalability of cloud-based data pipelines.
